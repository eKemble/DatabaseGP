The files for the website are index.php, header.php, calculator.php, dice.php, and warhammer_style.css as of this update (11-30-14 @ 11:30pm)

be sure to run the warhammer.sql file through postgres in order to make things run smoothly when testing on your end

I've updated the css style sheet enough that things look okay, and getting everything else working is currently more important, so its up now. within your GroupProject folder, create a folder named 'css', and put the file in there, and it should work just fine
